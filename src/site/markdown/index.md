# About Model

The Model component provides tools to generate DM documents and other artifacts from ontologies generated by [Protégé](http://protege.stanford.edu/). This enables data dictionary and ontology designers to share the changing morphology of the PDS model with the rest of the PDS nodes and the general public.

Please send comments, change requests and bug reports to the [PDS Operator](mailto:pds_operator@jpl.nasa.gov) at pds_operator@jpl.nasa.gov.
