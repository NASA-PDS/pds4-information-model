        <definition>For some observations, geometric parameters are given as instantaneous 
        	values at a specific time. Another set of instantaneous parameters are the 
        	parameters which give the minimum and maximum values in the product. 
        	In some cases, these range values are all calculated for the same time. 
        	If the label includes single valued geometric parameters or min/max range parameters 
        	determined for a specific time, geometry_reference_time_utc gives the time for which 
        	these values were calculated and must be given in the label.   	
        	
          For some instruments, particularly those with relatively large exposure durations, 
          (e.g., push broom cameras, many imaging spectrometers), many geometric quantities 
          are given as ranges. If those range parameters are associated with the beginning 
          and end of the observation (start_parameter/stop_parameter), geometry_start_time_utc/stop_time 
          must be given. 
                    
          Comments within the label should be used to ensure the parameter vs. time association 
          is unambiguous.

        <definition>The pair of geometry_start_time_utc/geometry_stop_time_utc may be given in the 
        	label for any observation. The pair is generally used for fairly long duration 
        	observations (a substantial portion of an hour to several hours). geometry_start_time_utc 
        	gives the time at the beginning of the observation.	When either geometry_start_time_utc 
        	or geometry_stop_time_utc is given, both must be provided. 

          Within the Geometry discipline, there are two options for providing geometric parameters
          as a range of values. A parameter may be given as a pair where the parameter values are 
          those at the beginning and end of the observation (start_parameter, stop_parameter). 
          If a (start_parameter, stop_parameter) pair is used for any geometric parameter, the pair 
          (geometry_start_time_utc/geometry_stop_time_utc) must be given.
          
          Another option to provide geometric parameters as a pair is (minimum_parameter, maximum_parameter)
          defining a range of values where the values are the minimum and maximum values of that 
          parameter for the entire observation.  
          
          Comments within the label should be used to ensure the parameter vs. time association 
          is unambiguous.

        <definition>The pair of geometry_start_time_utc/geometry_stop_time_utc may be given in the 
        	label for any observation. The pair is generally used for fairly long duration  
          observations (a substantial portion of an hour to several hours). geometry_stop_time_utc 
        	gives the time at the end of the observation.	When either geometry_start_time_utc 
        	or geometry_stop_time_utc is given, both must be provided.

          Within the Geometry discipline, there are two options for providing geometric parameters
          as a range of values. A parameter may be given as a pair where the parameter values are 
          those at the beginning and end of the observation (start_parameter, stop_parameter). 
          If a (start_parameter, stop_parameter) pair is used for any geometric parameter, the pair 
          (geometry_start_time_utc/geometry_stop_time_utc) must be given.
          
          Another option to provide geometric parameters as a pair is (minimum_parameter, maximum_parameter)
          defining a range of values where the values are the minimum and maximum values of that 
          parameter for the entire observation.  
          
          Comments within the label should be used to ensure the parameter vs. time association 
          is unambiguous.

                  For planet and satellite planetographic coordinate systems: 
                  Planetographic longitude is usually defined such that the sub-observer 
                  longitude increases with time as seen by a distant, fixed observer 
                  (0 to 360). The earth, moon and sun are exceptions; planetographic 
                  longitude is positive east by default (0 to 360). Planetographic 
                  latitude is planetodetic latitude (-90 to +90).
                  For dwarf planets, asteroids and comets: there are multiple, inconsistent 
                  standards. Currently, for these objects, PDS permits planetographic 
                  coordinates to be provided in addition to, not in lieu of, either

        <definition>The solution_id attribute specifies the unique identifier

          certain kinds of information, such as pointing correction (pointing 
          models) and rover localization (coordinate system definitions), the 
          "true" value is unknown and only estimates of the true value exist. 
          Thus, more than one set of estimates may exist simultaneously, each 
          valid for its intended purpose. Each of these sets is called a 
          "solution" to the unknown true value. The solution_id attribute is 
          used to identify which solution is being expressed by the containing 
          group. No specific naming convention is defined here, however it is 
          recommended that projects adopt one. The intent is to be able to 
          identify who created the solution, and why. Possible components of 
          the naming convention include user, institution, purpose, request ID, 
          version, program, date/time.

        <definition>The coordinate_space_frame_type attribute identifies the type of frame being
            described, such as SITE, LOCAL_LEVEL, LANDER, ROVER, ARM, etc. When combined with
            Coordinate_Space_Index and the optional solution_id in the Coordinate_Space_Indexed class,
            this serves to fully name an instance of a coordinate space.

            rotation in the horizontal direction. It may be measured from a low hard stop,
            or relative to a coordinate frame. Although it may be used for any instrument
            where it makes sense, it is primarily intended for use in surface-based instruments
            that measure pointing in terms of azimuth and elevation. If this value is expressed
            using a coordinate system, the coordinate system is specified by the
            Coordinate_Space_Reference class. The interpretation of exactly what part of
            the instrument is being pointed is mission-specific. It could be the boresight,
            the camera head direction, the CAHV camera model A vector direction, or any of a
            number of other things. As such, for multimission use this value should be used
            mostly as an approximation, e.g. identifying scenes which might contain a given object.

        <definition>The Quaternion_Base class defines a quaternion that represents
          rotation between two right-handed reference frames. In this dictionary, quaternions 
          are always constructed so that the application of the quaternion describes the 
          rotation of one frame to a second frame. The two frames and the direction of 
          rotation must be identified unambiguously in the enclosing classes.
          
          Quaternions are expressed as a set of four numbers in the order  
          (qcos, qsin1, qsin2, qsin3), where qcos = cos(theta/2) and 
           qsin(n) = sin(theta/2)*a(n). Theta is the angle of rotation and a is the
           unit vector (x,y,z) around which the rotation occurs.
          
          A document providing the full mathematical basis for this construction, 
          along with examples, and a summary of common pitfalls, is in preparation.
          The current version can be obtained by contacting the PDS Engineering Node.
                    
          In application you need to know the four elements of the quaternion, the two end 
          point frames, and the direction of the rotation. This dictionary provides two 
          extensions to this Base class. In the Quaternion_Plus_Direction class we require the direction of 
          rotation. This class can only be used if the two end point frames are identified in 
          the enclosing class. This is generally the case in the Lander section.
          The Quaternion_Plus_To_From class requires the two frames be identified explicitly with one 
          designated as the "from frame" and the other as the "to frame".

            and orientation (quaternion) of the camera at the time it was calibrated. The model is
            transformed ("pointed") for a specific image by computing, generally using articulation
            device kinematics, a final pose for the image. The camera model is then translated and
            rotated from the calibration to final pose. This class specifies the quaternion portion
            of the final pose.

<!-- Image_Display_Geometry class  -->

    <DD_Class>
        <name>Image_Display_Geometry</name>
        <version_id>4.0</version_id>
        <local_identifier>Image_Display_Geometry</local_identifier>
        <submitter_name>Mitchell K. Gordon</submitter_name>
        <definition>Image_Display_Geometry class provides an unambiguous description 
            of the orientation of the image contents. Given an image, displayed as 
            described by the Display_Direction class, any one of the Object_Orientation_* 
            classes should allow unambiguous orientation of the contents of the image. 
            The Local_Internal_Reference class is used to identify the object to which this
            instance of the Image_Display_Geometry class applies, and must be used if 
            there is more than one instance of Image_Display_Geometry in the label. The 
            appropriate value for local_reference_type is image_display_to_object.
            The Object_Orientation_North_East class is typically used for instruments for 
            which the entire field of view is a portion of the target surface (e.g., 
            instruments on Mars orbital spacecraft); otherwise use Object_Orientation_RA_Dec 
            (e.g., flyby missions, missions with orbit radii much larger than the target radius 
            such as Voyager or Cassini). At least one of these must be used. The two
            *_Identification classes used here are Central_Body (e.g., Saturn if you are using 
            Planetocentric or planetographic coordinates in the Saturn system) and Target when the 
            described object in the FoV is not the Central_Body. For example giving the orientation 
            of the pole of Enceladus in Saturn Planetocentric coordinates, Central_Body = Saturn, 
            Target = Enceladus. Bottom line: put in enough information so someone else can figure 
            out the orientation of the field of view. 
            We also offer an option to provide the pointing information as a quaternion.

            and angular velocity units for the other two dimensions. The included

        <definition>The CAHV model is a linear, perspective-projection camera model
            (equivalent to a pinhole camera).  It consists of four 3-vectors (C,A,H,V)
            that describe the internal and external camera model parameters needed to
            translate between 2D image coordinates and 3D world coordinates.  C
            (Vector_Center) is the 3D position of the pinhole (center of the entrance
            pupil).  A (Vector_Axis) is a unit vector normal to the image plane
            pointing outward.  H (Vector_Horizontal) is a composite vector encoding
            three quantities: H' (a vector in the image plane perpendicular to the
            vertical columns), Hs (the distance between the lens center and image
            plane, measured in horizontal pixels), and Hc (the horizontal image
            coordinate directly under C when moving parallel to A).  V
            (Vector_Vertical) similarly composites the analogous V', Vs, and Vc in
            the vertical direction.

        <definition>
            A new camera model designed to perform better fisheye-image rectification
            prior to 1D stereo correlation. The primary innovation is the use of a 
            unit projection sphere rather than an image plane. For epipolar alignment 
            between stereo cameras the rows (for a left/right pair) or the columns
            (for an up/down pair) of both must lie along the same plane. Thus we use 
            a pair of planes to define the rows and columns. Each plane will rotate 
            around a static dedicated axis passing through the sphere center. Pixels 
            will be located where the planes intersect with each other and the unit sphere.

            zoom) between points at which calibration was performed. If more than one dimension of
            variables were interpolated, multiple Interpolation objects can exist, with interpolation_sequence
            defining the order.

        <definition>The Motion_Counter class provides a set of integers that
            describe a (potentially) unique location (position / orientation) for a
            rover or other movable object. Each time an event occurs that results in  
            a movement, a new motion counter value is created. This includes 
            intentional motion due to drive commands, as well as potential motion
            due to other articulating devices, such as arms or antennae. This motion
            counter (or part of it) is used as a reference to define instances of
            coordinate systems that can move such as SITE or ROVER frames. The 
            motion counter is defined in a mission-specific manner. Although the 
            original intent was to have incrementing indices (e.g., MER), the motion 
            counter could also contain any integer values that conform to the above 
            definition, such as time or spacecraft clock values.
