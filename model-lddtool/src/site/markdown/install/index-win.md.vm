# Windows System Properties

The required environment variables for the _lddtool_ package can also be set through the Windows system properties panel. The instructions provided below were based off of a Windows 7 machine. Windows 8 and 10 users should be able to use these steps as well to modify their environment.

The _Path_ environment variable can be modified as follows:

- Click on the Windows icon on the bottom left. In the search text box, type in _edit system environment variables_. A search result called _Edit the system environment variables_ should appear under the _Control Panel_ area as follows:

- Click on _Edit the system environment variables_ and in there, click on the _Environment Variables_ button. At this point, you should now see a window like the one below:

- Highlight the _Path_ variable in the System Variables list and select the _Edit_ button.

- Append to the current contents of the variable, the path to the _bin_ directory within _lddtool_ package. Separate the package path from the current contents of the variable with a semicolon.

- Select the _OK_ button when you are finished editing the _Path_ variable, then select the _OK_ button on the Environment Variables window to apply the changes.

New environment variables (e.g., JAVA_HOME) may also be specified in the system properties panel. Instead of selecting the _Edit_ button from the System Variables list, select the _New_ button and enter the variable name and value. Select the _OK_ button when you are finished, then select the _OK_ button on the Environment Variables window to apply the changes.

Note: If you already have a DOS window open, you will need to close and re-open the window for the environment variable changes to take effect.
