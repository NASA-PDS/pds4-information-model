([Archive] of  Data_Element

	(column_desc "A place in which public records or historical documents are preserved; also the material preserved - often used in plural. Sometimes capitalized when referring to all of PDS holdings - the PDS Archive.")
	(column_name "Archive"))

([Array] of  Data_Element

	(column_desc "An N-dimensional data structure in which every element has an identical data type. For example, a structure with 5 rows and 3 columns in which each element is a 2-byte signed integer would be an array.")
	(column_name "Array"))

([Association] of  Data_Element

	(column_desc "An attribute that establishes a unidirectional relationship between two classes. For example, a table has records; 'has record' is the relationship between one entity (the table) and another (a record).")
	(column_name "Association"))

([Attribute] of  Data_Element

	(column_desc "A property or characteristic that provides a unit of information. For example, 'color' and 'length' are possible attributes.")

	(column_name "Basic_Product"))

([Bundle] of  Data_Element

	(column_desc "A list of collections. Product_Bundle, the bundle's manifestation, is itself a product (because it is simply a list embedded within a label); but it is not a basic product. For example, a bundle could list a collection of raw data obtained by an instrument during its mission lifetime, a collection of the calibration products associated with the instrument, and a collection of all documentation relevant to the first two collections.")
	(column_name "Bundle"))

([Cardinality] of  Data_Element

	(column_desc "The number of values allowed to an attribute or association in a single class. Cardinality in general is stated as a range with a minimum and maximum. For example, an optional attribute that may be multi-valued will have a cardinality of \"0..*\". A cardinality where the minimum and maximum are the same is often shown as the single value; for example, an attribute required to have exactly one value will have a cardinality of \"1\". When a value is required, the minimum cardinality is at least 1.")
	(column_name "Cardinality"))

([Class] of  Data_Element

	(column_desc "The set of attributes (including a name) which defines a family. A class is generic - a template from which individual members of the family may be constructed.

	(column_desc "An object which is intangible (and, because it is intangible, does not fit into a digital archive). Examples of 'conceptual objects' include the Cassini mission and NASA's strategic plan for solar system exploration.

	(column_name "Data_Structure"))

([Description_Object] of  Data_Element

	(column_desc "Something that describes an object. As appropriate, it will have structural and descriptive components. Technically speaking, a 'description object' in PDS4 is a 'digital object' - a string of bits; but we assume that we can read it and, on that basis, give it a special name.")
	(column_name "Description_Object"))

([Primary_Member] of  Data_Element

	(column_desc "A basic product is a primary member of the collection within which it first enters PDS4. Every basic product must be a primary member of one (and only one) collection. A product's member status (primary or secondary) is based on its first association with the collection. Although the product may be omitted from a later version of the collection, it retains its primary or secondary member status through all subsequent versions of the collection based on its initial association. In a similar way, collections are categorized as having either primary or secondary 'member status' in their bundles.")
	(column_name "Primary_Member"))

([Product] of  Data_Element

	(column_desc "One or more tagged objects (digital, non-digital, or both) grouped together and having a single PDS-unique identifier. In the PDS4 implementation, the descriptions are combined into a single XML label. Although it may be possible to locate individual objects within PDS (and to find specific bit strings within digital objects), PDS4 defines 'products' to be the smallest granular unit of addressable data within its complete holdings.")

([Secondary_Member] of  Data_Element

	(column_desc "A basic product may be a secondary member of any number of collections. A collection which lists references to basic products already registered in PDS would identify those products as its secondary members. For example, if all Voyager images were in one primary collection, an analyst could define a new (subset) collection containing images which had Saturn's rings within the field of view; each of those image products would be a secondary member of the new collection. A product's member status (primary or secondary) is based on its first association with the collection. Although the product may be omitted from a later version of the collection, it retains its primary or secondary member status through all subsequent versions of the collection based on its initial association. In a similar way, collections are categorized as having either primary or secondary 'member status' in their bundles.")
